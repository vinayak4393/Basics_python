Data types are classifications that specify which type of value a variable can hold in programming. 
They define the operations that can be performed on the data, 
the amount of memory allocated for it, and how the data is stored.

Integer ==> 10
Float ==> 10.5
Complex ==> 10+20j
String ==> "10"
List ==> [10]
Tuple ==> (10,)
Set ==> {10}
Dictionary ==> {"a":10}
Boolean type ==> (true or false)
None
